# Firefox-config-prefs.js
This repository contains multiple branches with prefs.js config file for firefox.  Depending on which branch you are at configs differ. By default master is the exact same config I use on a daily basis (master always contains *stable* setup.), while for example notebook_extreme is something I usualy set up on low-end PCs.

# Instalation

Copy and paste prefs.js file from this repo and replace your current one with it. Restart firefox and you are all set up.
